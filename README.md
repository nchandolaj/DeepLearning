# Deep Learning: From Fundamentals to Mastery

This repository documents my structured progression through Deep Learning concepts and projects. It serves as a central hub to track milestones, manage curriculum planning, and ensure consistent skill development.

## Methodology

* **AI-Assisted Workflow:** This is an AI-first learning initiative. I leverage **Gemini** as a technical co-pilot to accelerate curriculum planning, audit code quality, and assist with debugging.
* **Instructional Documentation:** I adopt the "Feynman Technique" for documentation. Notes and code comments are written in an instructional style, designed to explain the topic clearly as if being presented in an online course.

## Curriculum Roadmap

The learning path is divided into four distinct phases, moving from theoretical primitives to state-of-the-art application.

### Phase 1: Foundations
**Focus:** Establishing the mathematical and theoretical groundwork necessary for advanced work.
* *Key Topics:* Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, Neural Network primitives, and Backpropagation.

### Phase 2: Transformers
**Focus:** Gaining a deep understanding of the architecture that drives modern AI.
* *Key Topics:* Attention mechanisms, Self-Attention, Encoders/Decoders, and the evolution from RNNs to Transformer architectures.

### Phase 3: Large Language Models (LLMs)
**Focus:** Practical implementation and manipulation of pre-trained models.
* *Key Topics:* Fine-tuning, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Inference optimization, and Prompt Engineering.

### Phase 4: Mastery & Frontiers
**Focus:** Exploring state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques and evolving research.
* *Key Topics:* Multimodal systems, Autonomous Agents, and research paper implementation.

## Agile Approach

To maintain momentum, I treat this learning journey as a software product, utilizing Agile principles:

* **Sprints:** Learning goals are broken down into 1-2 week sprints with defined deliverables (e.g., "Implement a Transformer from scratch").
* **Iterative Refinement:** Code is written, reviewed (by AI), and refactored for performance and readability.
* **Retrospectives:** At the end of each phase, I review concepts to ensure retention before moving to the next complexity tier.
